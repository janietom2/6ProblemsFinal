                            A sequence of number is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

                    <p>
                        The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as different substrings even they consist of same characters.

                        <p>
                            This problem gives you an array that contains only numbers and the method should detect if the numbers in the array follow a sequence. This means that from left to right check if they have a similarity by being different because of a math operation. For example... 2, 4, 6 This is a sequence, since 2+2 =4 and 4+2 =6 and so on. The idea of this problem is from the array get how many sequences are in the array and count them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Again, the idea here is use dynamic programing. How is this posible? Dynamic programing basically solves a small problem for large scale problems too. Here, it can be used by extracting part of the array. Let say <i>A</i> is the array/list then we can get the size, with the size we can break it into parts. For example <i>len(A) = 9</i> we have 3 parts. Then iterate each part until reach the number of the portion. Then apply the same method to the rest of the array then if results into a boolean value of True it counts torward a counter which will be the final return statement (int) for the main method.
                        </p>

                        
                        <p>
                                Recursive definition could be as: <b>S = n^1/2</b> (Getting part of the array ,square root, if possible). <b>dp[i] = dp[i+1]-dp[i+2], </b>
                        </p>

                        <p>In conclusion we use a small solution to apply to a big problem so it can be reused as many times as possible</p>
